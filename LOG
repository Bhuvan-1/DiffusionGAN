First trained with 50 steps, 100 epochs.
    32,64 channels
    64,128 channels  ... both gave random noisy results.


Then trained with 200 steps.
    100epochs, 16,32 channels :  
    50epochs,  32,64 channels :

        both gave similiar results almost, and the images are a lot more smoothed now, though far from airplane looking.
        The heavier model, 32,64 seems to give more smoother images.

Then 300 steps, 100 epochs, (4,8,16) : just noise!!! model not powerful enough



Then 250 steps, 100 epochs, 16,32,64 channels.
    training time ~ <= 10sec/epoch

    similiar Results + NOt much difference.


Then 200 steps, 100 epochs, 64,128 channels....
    training time on cat : 10sec/epoch
    Results are better than 16,32,64 channels, could identify one airplane.


Then trying to train 200 steps, 100 epochs, 64,128,256
    time ~ 15-20sec per epochs.. 100 epochs = 25min
    
    

now same model, 500steps....
    trianing was quick enough in cat.
    Results were lot smoother.... try with 100 (ddpm paper used 1000)



1000 steps, 32_64   ---  1e-4 0.02 beta. --- 100epochs.
    okish images, still somewhat hazy blurry...



1000 steps, 64,128,256   ---  1e-4 0.02 beta. --- 150epochs.
    Much better images so far i guess. but still not aeroplanes...


?? Need to implemement eval metrics..
Try even heavier model ? 
Try more steps ?    .......... NO SAMPLING BECOMES TOOOO HEAVY.

    This with Adam optimiser, gave almost loss of 2,0.5
