First trained with 50 steps, 100 epochs.
    32,64 channels
    64,128 channels  ... both gave random noisy results.


Then trained with 200 steps.
    100epochs, 16,32 channels :  
    50epochs,  32,64 channels :

        both gave similiar results almost, and the images are a lot more smoothed now, though far from airplane looking.
        The heavier model, 32,64 seems to give more smoother images.

Then 300 steps, 100 epochs, (4,8,16) : just noise!!! model not powerful enough



Then 250 steps, 100 epochs, 16,32,64 channels.
    training time ~ <= 10sec/epoch

    similiar Results + NOt much difference.
