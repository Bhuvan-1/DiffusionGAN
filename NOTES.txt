######
gan training unstable..maybe need to tweak lerning rate.

or add a regularizer term as mentioned in the paper.

also see if the modles of D,G are correct or not.


#####
implement an evaluation metrix like emd score.




###
finally a graph of 

emdscore vs sampling time  for each method  with approx same model size (#params)

or 

emdscore vs T ... or something similiar just like the graphs in GAN  paper.
